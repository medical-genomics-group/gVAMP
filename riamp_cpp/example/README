## Data files are provided here as an example of how to run the software 

The plink test.bed/.bim/.fam files and two corresponding phenotypes
test1.phen and test2.phen were generated in R using the script data_sim.R

A dimension file is required with a single line containing the sample
size and the number of markers seperated by a space: test.dim

The group-index test.gri and group-mixture test.grm files allocate all 
markers to a single group with four mixture components


These files are then used in the Workflow section of the wiki page:
